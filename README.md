# FunJames, a AngularJS project

A spotify like music player. Made in collaboration with Bloc.io . Poject was made to gain a familiarity with the AngularJS framework.

# Motivation

AngularJS is a powerful tool that can create a highly interactive single page app and allows a team of developers work together efficiently. Unfortunately, AngularJS is a complicated and confusing tool to use at first glance. The motivation behind this project is to gain an understanding with how AngularJS works and for me to become comfortable with working under the AngularJS framework.
