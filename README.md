# Bloc Jams AngularJS

A spotify like music player. Made in collaboration with Bloc.io . Poject was made to gain a familiarity with the AngularJS framework.

# Motivation

AngularJS is a powerful tool that can create a highly interactive single page app and allows a team of developers work together efficiently. Unfortunately, AngularJS is a complicated and confusing tool to use at first glance. The motivation behind this project is to gain an understanding with how AngularJS works and for me to become comfortable with working under the AngularJS framework.





# Bloc Jams AngularJS Starter

This repository serves as a starter project for Bloc's AngularJS-driven music player app. 

To get started, [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository. Forking a repository makes a copy and adds it to your own GitHub account. This is an important step, because the your work will need be on your Github account and not Bloc's. 

Rename your forked repository to `bloc-jams-angularjs` in Github (available under the **Settings** tab of your repository).

Open your terminal, `cd` into your `~/bloc` directory, and clone your repository.
